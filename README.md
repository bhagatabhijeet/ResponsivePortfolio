## Description :

This is Abhijeet's portfolio. The goal of the project is to build a showcase for my other projects. 
The v1.0 of this project is built using HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap v4.5

## sub goals
While the project's goal is to showcase my profile this project also has several sub goals namely,

* Learn Bootstrap through actual implementation.
* Learn Grid system of bootstrap and various other component classes viz. jumbotron, Cards, headers and footers.

## Highlights
* The **portfolio** is made *simplistic* yet *elegant*.
* I have not cluttered too many images in the pages thus making it a professional portfolio.
* The *top nav bar* consistency is maintained across the pages.
* The footer is made sticky by design and merges with the color scheme of pages.
* Overall the color scheme is made consitent.
* The design is responsive(by Use of bootstrap) and has been tested on various screen sizes.
* Absolutely no use of media queries.
* Since the goal of v1.0 was to build using bootstrap hence, I have kept the JavaScript inline. The only purpose of the Inline JavaScript
is to animate the text fade-ins and fade-outs on the index page.
* Use of svg font awesome icons.
* Use of google fonts to make the design better.

## Forking Repo
forking the repo is absolutely fine. If you happen to like the overall scheme and bootstrap implementations's it would be good to give some credit.

# Future
* more projects to be added.
* Resume pdf navbar menu to be enabled. Currently the **RESUME** menu is disabled on purpose.
* Add color scheme details and Grid, Navbar, Card selector's details and how to override them. This will help people who fork.
